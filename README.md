Exercises The Bridge

Comments in some exercises.

## 1. Destructuring

* Simple destructuring
* Destructuring inside destructuring

## 2. Spread / Rest

* **addOnlyNum**: I've used checks with `!isNaN` and `Number()` to avoid concatenation of strings with the `+` operator.

## 3. Extras

* **onlyUniques**. I've converted the Array into a *Set()*, and spread it as an Array. *Set*s automatically ignore repeated values.

* **combineAllArrays**. After some attempts, `array.concat()` seems the simpler solution.
